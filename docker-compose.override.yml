# Development override: bind-mount prevance_health into the containers
# so that code changes (via Cursor or Cowork) are immediately reflected
# without rebuilding the Docker image.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# The main compose.yaml uses a baked Docker image (frappe/erpnext) that does NOT
# include prevance_health as a live bind mount — only the `sites` volume is mounted.
# This means code changes made in the DevContainer are invisible to the backend
# service unless this override is in effect.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# Docker Compose auto-loads docker-compose.override.yml from the same directory
# as the primary compose file. This file at the frappe_docker/ root is auto-loaded
# every time `docker compose up` is run from here — no -f flags needed.
#
# WHY BOTH configurator AND backend ARE LISTED
# The `configurator` service runs `ls -1 apps > sites/apps.txt` at startup.
# If prevance_health is not mounted into the configurator, it will not appear in
# apps.txt, and `bench new-site --install-app prevance_health` will fail.
# Both services must mount the same path for site creation and migration to work.
#
# FIRST-TIME SETUP (after `docker compose up -d`)
#   make new-site    # creates site, installs all apps, runs migrate
#
# AFTER CODE CHANGES
#   make migrate     # runs bench migrate to pick up schema changes
#
# DISCOVERED
# Spec 002 post-implementation: integration test `test_error_codes_integration.py`
# was created on Feb 19 but was absent from the backend container (image dated Feb 17).
# Root cause: no bind mount for app code → backend always used stale baked image.
# See: .specify/retrospectives/spec-002-retrospective.md Amendment Candidate 5.
# Configurator gap found during T067 diagnosis (Spec 002, session 5, 2026-02-19).

services:
  configurator:
    volumes:
      # Must mirror backend mount so that `ls -1 apps` in configurator sees prevance_health
      # and writes it into sites/apps.txt before any bench new-site command runs.

  backend:
    volumes:
      # Bind-mount prevance_health so the backend container always uses current code.
      # Source: relative to this file (frappe_docker/ root)
      # Destination: where bench expects to find the app inside the container
